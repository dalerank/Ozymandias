This is a fork of the **Julius/Augustus** project with the aim of making it work with _Pharaoh_ instead of _Caesar 3_.

The work is still in progress, so any help or support is appreciated. You can more or less load
original save games and play the first few missions in the campaign without major issues.

If you're looking for _Caesar 3_'s vanilla experience with modern machine compatibility, check out [Julius](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius).<br>
If you want additional features and visual/UI improvements, and don't care about strict
compatibility with the original save files, check out [Augustus](https://github.com/Keriew/augustus).<br>
For the original game, check out the page on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/564530/Pharaoh__Cleopatra/)
or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/pharaoh_cleopatra).<br>
For the official upcoming remaster (unrelated to Akhenaten) called _A New Era_, check out the Steam page [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1351080/Pharaoh_A_New_Era/).

Say thanks @banderi for new fork and new repo
